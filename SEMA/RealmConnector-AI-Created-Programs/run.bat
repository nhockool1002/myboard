Sure! Here's the code for the run.bat file:

```
@echo off
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

When the user runs the run.bat file, it will first install the dependencies mentioned in the requirements.txt file using the `pip install -r` command. Then it will execute the `main.py` file using the `python` command.
