I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. As an AI language model, I am unable to make changes to code stored in repositories. However, I can provide you with an optimized version of your Python script:

```python
import subprocess

AVAILABLE_COMMANDS = {
    "run": "Run the main.py program",
    "help": "Show available commands",
    "exit": "Quit the chatbot"
}


def run_program():
    try:
        subprocess.run(["python", "main.py"])
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("Error: Unable to find the main.py file.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred while running the program.\n{e}")


def handle_command(command):
    lower_command = command.lower()
    if lower_command == "run":
        run_program()
    elif lower_command == "help":
        print("Available commands:")
        for cmd, description in AVAILABLE_COMMANDS.items():
            print(f" - {cmd}: {description}")
    elif lower_command == "exit":
        print("Goodbye!")
        exit()
    else:
        print("Invalid command. Type 'help' to see available commands.")


while True:
    user_input = input(">>> ")
    handle_command(user_input)
```

This version of the script optimizes the `handle_command()` function by removing the unnecessary check for command existence in `AVAILABLE_COMMANDS`. Instead, it directly checks the command in an if-elif structure. It also includes an else block to handle invalid commands.

I hope this revised code meets your requirements. Let me know if you have any further questions!
